    <div class="faq-content" style="padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px;">
        <div class="questions">
            <li class="sub-information">
                Apply Waterproofing: When you bring your new shoes home, spray them with a waterproof protector to keep
                the surface from being ruined if they get wet in the rain. The staff at Perfect Shoes Plus will
                recommend the right protector based on your shoes’ material.
            </li>
            <li class="sub-information">
                Add Reinforcements: To add years to the life of your shoes, have a shoe repair person add
                taps and half-soles of rubber to the bottoms.
            </li>
            <li class="sub-information">
                Wear Proper Socks: Don’t skip the socks. Socks not only keep your feet warm and prevent blisters, but
                they also protect against perspiration, which erodes the insoles. Perfect Shoes Plus offers many types
                of socks that work with a variety of shoes, including compression hosiery and diabetic footwear for
                swelling and varicose veins, pantyhose and trouser socks for dress shoes, and thick socks for hiking or
                work boots.
            </li>
            <li class="sub-information">
                Use A Shoe Tree: Don’t keep your shoes in a pile on the floor of your closet. To help retain the shoe’s
                shape, use shoe trees.
            </li>
            <li class="sub-information">
                Alternate Pairs: If you are in the habit of wearing the same shoes every day, you might want to rethink
                that. Shoes need to have time to breathe between wearings, especially if your feet perspire a lot. To
                give your shoes time to dry out, change shoes daily. Your shoes will have a longer lifespan if you
                alternate them.
